	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p><b>Mission Statement</b><br />
	"MHNA is an association of local churches and volunteers who have discovered that by combining our  limited human and material resources we can do more to address the various needs of our neighbors, particularly recent immigrants and low-income families.  Through this multi-congregational, multi-service approach, MHNA is re-creating a sense of neighborhood, a “village center” within our internationally diverse community of Murray Hill and greater Flushing.  Our shared desire is to demonstrate God’s love in Jesus Christ to every resident in Murray Hill.”</p>

	<p><b>Brief History and Support</b><br />
	The Murray Hill Neighborhood Association was sponsored and incorporated by the joint efforts of the Immanuel Community and First Presbyterian Churches of Flushing as a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization in 1999. Today MHNA receives voluntary, material, and financial support from an increasing number of local congregations and individuals. MHNA programs have been awarded numerous grants through foundations, government, and denominational agencies. MHNA financial statements are reviewed yearly by a Certified Public Accountant.</p>
	
	<p>Your financial or voluntary support is always welcomed! Please feel free to call for more information or to volunteer in any of our programs.</p>
	 
	<p><b>Future Growth</b><br />
